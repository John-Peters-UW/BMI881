## Review 

This paper (and little other mention thingy) was on a commentary (and review) on different randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the results they had for recommending mammogram testing for breast cancer screening in women from 40-49 years of age. The author pointed out many points of confusion from these different studies. The author commonly disputed the significance and importance of the findings in coming to a sound conclusion if mammograms were worthwhile testing. Some concerns were on the statistical significance of these RCTs, the found significance of how many years/months/days on average this helps woman, and how the studies sometimes misrepresent (in one case, double listing) the negative effects (and sometimes the positive ones) of mammograms. 

I think my personal thoughts towards this paper really focus on one comment that the author made. On page 3 of the PDF, the author mentions that the arbitrary significance of 5% has many statisticians taking the results of a study as extreme fact, when instead, it's clear that the significance of that study is debatable, and the degree at which what was shown in the study makes it a more nuanced discussion with woman if they should go for mammograms or not. 

## Discussion Questions:

- Do we see an uptick on radiation induced cancers from screening, and can we tell those cancers apart from other cancers.

- Do we screen mammograms the same way that we did when this paper was written, or are there techniques that we use now that weren't in consideration back then and might change the author's view?
