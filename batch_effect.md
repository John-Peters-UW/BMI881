## Review 

This paper was an overview of batch effect as it applies to high throughput omics data. These effects are what we can call spurious correlations that occur because of the conditions of an experiment. Often times, these could be the machine used, the technician, or other variables that change between experiments that aren't otherwise usually controlled for. These usually are consistent across the output of each experiment. This paper specifically looked into some surrogate (scapegoat) variables and defined how much confounding evidence they added to various experiments. The authors bring up some consequences of this, and some methods to try to control for these effects.

I think this paper is a good overview of batch effects. I think it's a concern that we see more and more, and something that will have to be tackled in some capacity as studies expand beyond single experiments (or even within studies this can have some effect). It's something that is a concern in my research, and I do deep learning on images. It's a good topic.

## Discussion Questions:

- Statistical methods for controlling for batch effect were suggested. Are there current popular packages that make exploring this streamlined?

- What are some data types (like how I mentioned images) where batch effect is a concern but might not be in a domain where batch effect is commonly talked about?
