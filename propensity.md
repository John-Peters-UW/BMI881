## Review 

The paper we read this time was an overview on propensity, though different sections of this paper went over adjacently related topics. A core focus of this paper is matching with a propensity score. The authors with this method are trying to allow for some control in the samples of observational studies. They want to remove the effect of participants choosing treatments based on their characteristics and model something more to the effect of a random sampling of participants that are taking or not taking the treatment. Modeling the bias (of sampling from certain distributions of patients) and being able to correct for it is a main goal of the paper and is what each of the theorems are poised to help with.

I think this paper was a little iffy in direction. At some points, it felt like reading a textbook that forgot why they were introducing a topic. I also don't quite understand the statistics of the actual scores themselves -- I don't have hours to go over something that is not useful for my research. I think the authors failed to implement their method in real studies, though. There weren't any examples of this method working, even at a simulated level. I don't think having proofs for your method is enough to propose that other's use it. I think examples are very necessary.

## Discussion Questions:
- What kind of studies are these bias countering methods useful for and how large of a sample is required?
- Are these hard to use in practice? Are there concerns not explicitly clear from the paper that might make this method less or more useful in certain situations?
