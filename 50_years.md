To start, before I get into the review, could I suggest that more papers like this and the two cultures be applied towards this course? I really prefer these kinds of papers versus the papers that we might read about clinical trials (and I find the discussions so much more entertaining). 

I think one sample paper from different disciplines we might see from faculty (clinical/theoretical/gwas|summary stats/ML/DL), and then an exploration on the feels about each of the fields works nicely as a general organized structure for what types and papers to read in the course to make it more fun for future years. Anyway, onto the review.

## Review 

The author of 50 Years of Data Science presents a summary of the differences between what could be described as data science, machine learning, and statistics. The author argues against the view that statistics has and always was data science. They expand on the definitions of machine learning, statistics and data science to show how much more data science encompasses and how it truly could be defined as an actual science (and one that will be very impactful in their future predictions). 

They define data science as more of an industry-like application of applied statistics and machine learning. But, at the same time address the vast amount of effort and improvement in tooling used to approach problems in industry settings. They relate the improvement to not only theory but towards making sure all of the field improve in their workflows and tooling to show the science of data science: The science of improving science. Or at least improving the science in the bubble that data science claims. It's using the empirical analysis of current workflows and tools to improve them to contribute towards a better, open, scientific basis of knowledge.

The author then presents a broad definition of what they call Greater Data Science which I will not go into but encompasses the different knowledge spheres that are required for a data scientist and how current curriculum in statistics departments don't necessarily cover what is required of data scientists and why the statisticians might not have claim over the term.

I think the points the author makes are excellent, and parallels a lot of my feelings. I always have had the feeling that statistics is deeply mired in the trappings of a deep mathematical deluge. It's unfortunate, and I think we see now the consequences of it constantly as students. I find that the opinion of statistics is always in a decline from students even from within statistics (one of the students in my lab is a statistics runaway. The stories he tells of how so many faculty treat their students is a very sad (and not uncommon) show for the department).

I further agree with the subjects the paper brings up on the requirements of data science and how it could be a science itself. I lament the fact that we as a program tilt towards a facade of data science (as what the statisticians in the paper would claim they are doing) rather than towards promoting the more broad range of abilities a data scientist should have.

I think this paper has me seeing parallels of the statistics departments (that we have and as described in the paper) woes in our own department, with I think a focus too much on specificity and depth in few subjects (which our labs do to teach us well) over the ability (to even possibly, if students wanted to) to learn broadly applicable tools, processes, and basic data science techniques which are not what labs (nor most undergraduate degrees students come in with) generally focus on. It would be great if we had tracks and missions (as in mission statements) which showed our pursuit in teaching our students these valuable aspects of data science over the theoretical (2/3) focus that we currently have.

## Discussion Questions:

Do you think, we as a program, are doing enough to call ourself data scientists, or are the vast majority of us machine learning practitioners and statisticians?

Do you think that theoretical statistics will ever move away from mathematics in their teaching and discovery or are the fields too closely linked?

Why is the focus so much on R from statisticians versus languages that are actually used outside of academics?
