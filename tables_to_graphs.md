# Let's practice what we Preach: Turning Tables into Graphs

## Review 

The authors of Tuning Tables into Graphs present a dated view on how some of the basic tables that we use today can improve data presentation. Using S (Wow, this is old), they demonstrated how some basic tables could be made into line, histogram, and bar graphs/charts. With these demonstrations, the authors also gave some (what we would consider basic) tips on graph layout, text additions and so on. 

My reaction to this paper was that it was bland at best. There were several errors (missing spaces), and phrasings that I strongly disagree about placing into a paper. Calling subjects that like graphs over tables and educational level more sophistocated just rubbed me the wrong way. It colored my view of the paper negatively afterwards and ruined my appreciation for some (dated) suggestions that were actually no too bad. It's hard to really get anything from this paper, because all data science coursework and material that we consume in this modern age are so much more comprehensive and use tools which can produce much better visualizations than existed then.

## Discussion Questions:

What are aspects of this paper, that are recommended, that we no longer recommend today?

What is everyone favorite graphing libraries and languages? Are we all team R, Python or Julia?
