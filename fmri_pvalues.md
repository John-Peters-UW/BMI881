## Review 

The authors of this paper present a view on the statistical testing that was being used for fMRI images. The paper comprised of many test, most I didn't really understand (voxels, here?), but are separated into non-parametric and parametric testing. It was found in this paper, that all of the methods that were being tested in fact had vastly over-estimated significance (and even a a 15 year old bug) and had very inflated false-positive rates. The authors used popular and widely used statistical software for these tests, and remarked on how they had up to a 70% false positive rate and were rarely/never empirically validated with real fMRI data. Lastly, there were some remarks on data being not accessible anymore (or ever), and that there needs to be efforts in validating the current widely used methods, as the authors found them all wanting. 

## Discussion Questions:

- Are there data that we work with where the wet lab community has poor data sharing practices?

- What other fields (I don't know) have an older technology like fMRI available yet don't validate claims with real data?
