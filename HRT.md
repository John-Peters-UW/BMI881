## Review 

This was a read of a series of papers. The first was a study does (simplifying heavily here) a cohort of women who went on HRT (estrogen plus progestin) for the purpose of menopausal control. Initially, there was a study by the Women's Health Initiative that suggested that there was an increase of coronary heart disease rates for women who went on HRT. Followup studies (what we focused our reading on) qualified these results, and found that based on the study design, these results could be more or less accounted for. The biggest factor being years since menopause (10+ being the worse for CHD prevalence), which wasn't entirely accounted (stratified?) for in the original study.

I'm uncertain how to feel about the original study and the followup discussions that we read. There are some serious consequences for even slightly different study design, and I feel a strong takeaway is the understanding that we must frame results correctly, always. The way we design trials and statistically weigh them have a very small window of truth that is proven. We did not read the original study by WHI, so I'm not quite sure how it was framed, but in the first part of the readings (the study that showed it was due to menopause starting time) sounded like the way it was framed in the WHI study was poor. I think that might be my biggest takeaway and thought here.

## Discussion Questions:

- With some of the follow up discussion on "black-box" techniques, how does ML (and deep learning) interpretability impact how strongly we can inspect and qualify the results that we present?

- When a back and forth is going on like this, how does clinical recommendations for some of these drugs change during these years? Or is that process separate than academic proof showing concerns?
