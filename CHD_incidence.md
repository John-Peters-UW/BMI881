## Review 

This week, we were to read two papers. These papers both are discussing how coronary heart disease and LDL Cholesterol are linked. The first paper, sub-titled "Reduction in incidence of Coronary Heart Disease" sets the stage for what is at stake here, with projections of health and cost (in dollars) defining how bad CHD (Coronary Heart Disease) truly is. This paper also presents a double blind study, which is very well defined in this paper, to test over the span of (up to) 9 years the effect of cholestyramine resin on CHD incidence. To no surprise, taking the drug lowered incidence across all follow up years even more than the placebo group which just strictly followed a diet aimed at lowering LDL cholesterol. The next paper in this sequence went over some questions that might arise from the first study. It meant to qualitatively analyze what exactly was controlling the results from the first study.

I feel like these papers were standard classical clinical trials work in addition to showing how some of the conclusions we take as common knowledge now came to be. We know, and are told that LDL is bad for you, and that it and hypertension are leading causes of heart disease. This paper showed that for LDL and it did so by using a fairly text-book double blind study. They were okay papers, though I'm not quite sure what we were supposed to get out of them, if we aren't in the clinical trials world. It's hard to take anything from these papers and apply them to deep representation learning on cell painting and other cell imaging datasets, for an oddly specific example.  

## Discussion Questions:

What steps could have been taken to increase study participation rate and participant retention?

What new knowledge has come from meta-analysis of these RCT trials that we see in the given papers and more since the time this one was written?
